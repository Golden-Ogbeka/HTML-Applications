This website is all about Jesus because all things in this world focuses on Him.<br />
He is the Alpha and the Omega. The Beginning and the End. He know your end<br />
from your beginning. He is Awesome. He is Super. There are not enough words to describe<br />
Him because He is just too much to describe. He is my Savior, My Redeemer, my Provider<br/>
my Sustainer, he is my all in all. My whole life is centered around Him. My whole life depends<br/>
on Him. Without Him, I can do nothing.
<p>
So what stops me from praising Him? What stops me from worshipping Him? What  stops me<br/>
from communicating with Him when I know that He is the Author and Finisher of my faith?
