<h1>This is God's assignment</h1>
<h3>It is all about Jesus</h3>
My name is <strong><font color ="Red">Golden</font></strong>.
 I just want to <font color ="Blue">talk</font> about myself for a while. 
 I <em>love</em> <font size="5">Jesus</font> and I know He <em>loves</em> me too.<br />
I also <em>love </em>my <font color="violet"> Father</font> in Heaven because He first <em>loved</em>
 me and He sent His only <font color ="orange">begotten </font>son to die for me<br />
And so I just want it serve Him with all of my heart and will all of my soul<br />
<p> This is just a summary</p>
<p> So sit back and wait for more...</p>
